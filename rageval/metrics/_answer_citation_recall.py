_DESCRIPTION = """\
Citation recall determines if the result from LLM is entirely supported by cited passages.

In different RAG evaluation tasks, both ‘contexts’ and ‘gt_contexts’ may be used as part of the input of LLM.
This metric doesn't care whether the ‘contexts’ come from real-time retrieval or annotated datasets.
For simplicity, we refer to all contexts collectively as ‘contexts’.

For details, see the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14627.
