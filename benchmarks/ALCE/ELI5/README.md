# ALCE-ELI5

---

## Description

`ALCE-ELI5` is different from the original `ELI5` dataset. The description of the original paper<sup>[1]</sup> on this dataset is as follows.
> ELI5<sup>[2]</sup> is a long-form QA dataset built on the Reddit forum “[Explain Like I’m Five](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/)”, with an average answer length of 131 words. Most ELI5 questions are how/why/what questions that require in-depth long answers and multiple passages as evidence. Due to the diverse range of topics discussed in the questions, we use Sphere<sup>[3]</sup>--a filtered version of Common Crawl7—as the corpus. The ELI5 dataset is widely used in related work due to its challenging nature<sup>[4][5][6]</sup>.
> 
> We randomly select 1,000 examples from the development set of each dataset for ALCE. Our benchmark primarily assesses the citation capabilities of existing LLMs and does not provide training data, as there are no available examples that provide supervision for citations in these datasets.

### Dataset

The ALCE-ELI5 dataset consists of two versions: `BM25` and `Oracle`. Both versions contain 1000 data entries with consistent questions. In the `BM25` version, each entry provides the top-100 passages retrieved using BM25 from the Sphere corpus. The `Oracle` version approximates golden passages through passages reranking, resulting in higher-quality passages compared to the `BM25` version. Each passage is segmented into chunks of 100 words.

The original data only consists of long answers. To facilitate evaluation, the authors used InstructGPT (text-davinci-003) to generate three `sub-claims` for each answer.

Additionally, each data entry includes annotated versions of `Summary` and `Snippet` generated by ChatGPT.

### Example

```
{
    "question": "How are firms like snapchat, uber etc valued so highly while still not making a profit? Do venture capitalists not expect some form of repayment within a number of years?",
    "question_ctx": "[removed]",
    "answer": "Yes. Did you watch The Social Network? They went a while before introducing ads, so they could make money, as they needed to establish their brand and amass users. Once you have dedicated users, introducing ads won't deter most, but if you are still new, having ads will deter a lot. The same goes for Uber, it's not that they aren't making money, it's that they are reinvesting a ton of it to make their service better.",
    "claims": [
        "Firms like Snapchat and Uber need to establish their brand and amass users before introducing ads.",
        "Introducing ads too early can deter potential users.",
        "Uber is reinvesting a lot of money to make their service better."

            "extraction": "Venture capitalists invest in startups with the expectation of a big payout down the road, either through an initial public offering or an acquisition. This means that the investors expect the company to eventually become profitable and generate returns on their investment. However, in the case of firms like Snapchat and Uber, they are valued highly because of their potential for future growth and dominance in their respective markets, rather than current profitability. Therefore, venture capitalists may not expect repayment within a specific number of years but instead expect a significant"

The answer lies with a special category of investment activity known as venture capital. Venture capitalists are professional investors who invest in a number of highly scalable high-risk technology ventures hoping to make a multi-fold",

## Metrics

In the original paper, the authors evaluated four metrics on the ELI5 dataset: MAUVE, Claim Recall, Citation Recall, and Citation Precision. 

Additionally, metrics such as ROUGE were also included in the evaluation, but no performance comparisons were made.

### MAUVE

MAUVE<sup>[7]</sup> measures the similarity between two text distributions. Specifically, we concatenate the question and the model output and compare it to the distribution of question-gold-answer concatenation.

**We will add this metric in future work.**

### Claim Recall

The Claim Recall is to measure the correctness of long-form answers. In the original paper, the author first use Instruct-GPT(text-davinci-003) to generate three "sub-claims" (based on gold answers) and use a state-of-the-art natural-language inference (NLI) model TRUE<sup>[8]</sup> to check whether the model output entails the sub-claims.

### Citation Recall

Citation recall determines if the result from LLM is entirely supported by cited passages.

### Citation Precision

Citation precision evaluation detects citations that are irrelevant to the claim, but it does not require citing a minimal set and it permits citing redundant passages entailing similar claims.

## Behavior of existing LLM

### BM25
| Model           | MAUVE | Claim Recall | Citation Recall | Citation Precision |
|-----------------|-------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Llama-2-7b-chat | --    | 11.5         | 26.6238         | 74.5455            |


### Oracle
| Model           | MAUVE | Claim Recall | Citation Recall | Citation Precision |
|-----------------|-------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Llama-2-7b-chat | --    | --           | --              | --                 |
