Thereafter, licenses were given to D'Arcy Exploration Company and Whitehall Petroleum but neither company found oil of commercial value and they returned their licenses in 1923. A new license covering was given to Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a consortium of Shell and British Petroleum (then known as Anglo-Iranian).

If the Senate votes to dissolve itself into the Committee of the Whole, in which all members are part of the Committee, the President Pro-Tempore presides over the proceedings, with the Lieutenant Governor acting as a regular voting member.

Club\", wrote that \"things become sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew into a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick does not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a growing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea of walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that this decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of murder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group and forced his own son to put down his mother\". \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Laura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open the lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you consider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with vendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of\" Slant Magazine\" described the episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a conspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of disconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene ends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a foreboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden strike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how the episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in the show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode \"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking lengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it helps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first place. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who probably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the gate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that when Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar shoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers that Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in the series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I loved the way Andrew went out!

In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross. Initially when the dreamer sees the Cross, he notes how it is covered with gems. He is aware of how wretched he is compared to how glorious the tree is. However, he comes to see that amidst the beautiful stones it is stained with blood. In section two, the Cross shares its account of Jesus' death. The Crucifixion story is told from the perspective of the Cross. It begins with the enemy coming to cut the tree down and carrying it away. The tree learns that it is not to be the bearer of a criminal, but instead Christ crucified. The Lord and the Cross become one, and they stand together as victors, refusing to fall, taking on insurmountable pain for the sake of mankind. It is not just Christ, but the Cross as well that is pierced with nails. Adelhied L. J. Thieme remarks, \"The cross itself is portrayed as his lord's retainer whose most outstanding characteristic is that of unwavering loyalty\". The Rood and Christ are one in the portrayal of the Passion\u2014they are both pierced with nails, mocked and tortured. Then, just as with Christ, the Cross is resurrected, and adorned with gold and silver. It is honoured above all trees just as Jesus is honoured above all men. The Cross then charges the visionary to share all that he has seen with others. In section three, the author gives his reflections about this vision. The vision ends, and the man is left with his thoughts. He gives praise to God for what he has seen and is filled with hope for eternal life and his desire to once again be near the glorious Cross.","question":"In section one of the dream of the rood what is the rood eventually drenched in beyond the gems?","short_answers":["blood"],"wikipage":"Dream of the Rood"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"In section two of the dream of the rood what is the rood eventually drenched in?","short_answers":["gold and silver"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"No context provided","question":"In section one of the dream of the rood what precious items is the rood drenched in?","short_answers":["gems"],"wikipage":null}],"wikipages":[{"title":"Dream of the Rood","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dream%20of%20the%20Rood"}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross.

At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself.

The Meat Inspection Act was assigned to what is now known as the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which remains in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first federal law regulating foods and drugs, the 1906 Act's reach was limited to foods and drugs moving in interstate commerce. Although the law drew upon many precedents, provisions, and legal experiments pioneered in individual states, the federal law defined \"misbranding\" and \"adulteration\" for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards. The law was principally a \"truth in labeling\" law designed to raise standards in the food and drug industries and protect the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.","question":"Who signed the Pure Food and Drug Act into law?|Which president signed the passage of the Pure Food and Drug act?","short_answers":["Theodore Roosevelt","President Theodore Roosevelt"],"wikipage":"Pure Food and Drug Act"},{"context":"The was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by Congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration.

Spatial recruitment is the activation of more motor units to produce a greater force.

Temporal motor unit recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the motor unit fibres from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches \"fuse\" temporally.

The nucleation sites that act as a source for the ongoing effervescence are not natural imperfections in the glass, but actually occur where the glass has been etched by the manufacturer or the customer.

If these arms contain an overdensity of stars compared to the average density of stars in the Galactic disk, it would be detectable by counting the stars near the tangent point. Two surveys of near-infrared light, which is sensitive primarily to red giants and not affected by dust extinction, detected the predicted overabundance in the Scutum\u2013Centaurus arm but not in the Carina\u2013Sagittarius arm: the Scutum\u2013Centaurus Arm contains approximately 30% more red giants than would be expected in the absence of a spiral arm. This observation suggests that the Milky Way possesses only two major stellar arms: the Perseus arm and the Scutum\u2013Centaurus arm. The rest of the arms contain excess gas but not excess old stars. In December 2013, astronomers found that the distribution of young stars and star-forming regions matches the four-arm spiral description of the Milky Way.

Millard had initially declined a request from Grant's record label to allow her to record the song; some segments of the Christian community had reacted negatively to her divorce, and Millard wasn't sure if he wanted to be involved. After consulting with his pastor, who felt Millard should accept the opportunity, Millard began to reconsider, and finally agreed to let her cover it after talking with Grant over the phone. Grant had planned to release her version of the song as the first single from her upcoming album and MercyMe would release a different song as their first single, hoping to capitalize on having written what would presumably become a major hit for Grant. The band released their first single from the album, \"Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)\", which performed poorly at Christian radio, leading to poor sales of \"Almost There\". Plans were made to release a second single from the record, but the band's manager, Scott Brickell, decided to reach out to Grant to see if she still planned to release her version as a single. Grant gave MercyMe her blessing to release the song as their second single and signed the rights back to the band; \"I Can Only Imagine\" was released on October 12, 2001 as the album's second single.","question":"When was the Christian Rock song i can only imagine first released?","short_answers":["October 12, 2001"],"wikipage":"I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"When was David Guetta's i can only imagine first performed?","short_answers":["February 12, 2012"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"No context provided","question":"When was David Guetta's i can only imagine first released as a single?","short_answers":["April 23, 2012"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"The song debuted on the Christian AC chart on November 2, 2001, reached the No. 1 position on February 22, 2002, and spent two weeks at the top spot.

Occurring approximately two-thirds into the film, the song assumes a role that was originally occupied by the song \"If I Can't Love Her\" in the Broadway musical, identified by Fred Hawson of \"ABS-CBN News\" as \"a grand moving solo\" during which the Beast sincerely expresses his undying feelings for Belle. In \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Evermore\" appears as a solo performed by the Beast shortly before \"The Mob Song\" as the film approaches its dramatic climax. After the Beast and Belle (Emma Watson) share a dance in the castle's ballroom to Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) singing \"Beauty and the Beast\", the couple has a conversation during which the Beast learns how much Belle actually misses her father, Maurice (Kevin Kline). Finally admitting that Belle is no longer his prisoner, the character sings \"Evermore\" shortly after he releases the heroine from the castle, insisting that she return to her village and protect Maurice from Gaston (Luke Evans). Believing that Belle has been lost to him forever, the Beast is heartbroken by the character's departure and laments his misfortune by performing \"Evermore\", accepting that releasing his former prisoner makes breaking the enchantress' spell more difficult, even impossible. Serving as a culmination of both the Beast's personal and emotional journeys, Tracy Goldman of \"The\" \"Cornell Daily Sun\" observed that the song \"adds more depth to the character\" by \"highlighting the changes he goes through throughout the movie.\"","question":"Which character sang the song evermore in the movie beauty and the beast?","short_answers":["Beast"],"wikipage":"Evermore (Beauty and the Beast song)"},{"context":"\"Evermore\" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for the musical fantasy film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017), a live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name.

{"ambiguous_question":"Where do you find a simple gear train?","qa_pairs":[{"context":"The simplest transmissions, often called gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, an increase in speed), sometimes in conjunction with a right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending from one side of the implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction. So too Helicopters use a split-torque gearbox where power is taken from the engine in two directions for the different rotors. The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.","question":"What part of machines do you often find a simple gear train?","short_answers":["gearboxes","gearbox"],"wikipage":"Transmission (mechanics)"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"What non-motorized personal vehicle do you often find a simple gear train?","short_answers":["bike","bicycle","cycle"],"wikipage":null}],"wikipages":[{"title":"Simple machine","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Simple%20machine"},{"title":"Transmission (mechanics)","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Transmission%20%28mechanics%29"},{"title":"Epicyclic gearing","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Epicyclic%20gearing"},{"title":"Fixed-gear bicycle","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fixed-gear%20bicycle"},{"title":"Gear train","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gear%20train"},{"title":"Gear","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gear"}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"A gear train is a mechanical system formed by mounting gears on a frame so the teeth of the gears engage.","wikipage":"Gear train"},{"content":"Gear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, providing a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next","wikipage":"Gear train"},{"content":"Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source.","wikipage":"Gear"},{"content":"Gears of different sizes produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine.","wikipage":"Gear"}],"long_answer":"A gear train is a mechanical system formed by mounting gears on a frame with rotating, interlocking teeth.

Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u2013V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80\u00a0km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80\u00a0km longer than previously thought.

These cells have the ability to spontaneously produce an electrical impulse (action potential; see below for more details), that travels through the heart via the electrical conduction system (see figure 1) causing it to contract. In a healthy heart, the SA node continuously produces action potential, setting the rhythm of the heart and so is known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The rate of action potential production (and therefore the heart rate) is influenced by nerves that supply it.","question":"Where are the group of  muscle cells that control the natural resting heart rate found?","short_answers":["atria","Right Atrium"],"wikipage":"Sinoatrial node"},{"context":"If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker. This center is typically represented by cells inside the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is an area between the atria and ventricles, within the atrial septum. If the AV node also fails, Purkinje fibers are occasionally capable of acting as the default or \"escape\" pacemaker.

An action potential is a change in voltage (membrane potential) across the membrane of the cell, produced by the movement of charged atoms (ions). Non-pacemaker cells (including the ventricular and atrial cells) have a period, immediately after an action potential, where the membrane potential remains relatively constant; this is known as a resting membrane potential. This resting phase (see cardiac action potential, phase 4) ends when another action potential reaches the cell. This produces a positive change in membrane potential (known as depolarisation), which initiates the start of the next action potential. Pacemaker cells, however, don\u2019t have this resting phase. Instead, immediately after one action potential, the membrane potential of these cells begins to depolarise again automatically, this is known as the pacemaker potential. Once the pacemaker potential reaches a set value, known as the threshold value, it then produces an action potential. Other cells within the heart (including the purkinje fibers and atrioventricular node; AVN) can also initiate action potentials; however, they do so at a slower rate and therefore, if the SA node is working, it usually beats the AVN to it.","question":"Where are the cells that control the resting heart rate found?","short_answers":["SA node","sinoatrial node"],"wikipage":"Sinoatrial node"}],"wikipages":[{"title":"Atrioventricular node","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atrioventricular%20node"},{"title":"Sinoatrial node","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sinoatrial%20node"},{"title":"Cardiac pacemaker","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cardiac%20pacemaker"},{"title":"Heart rate","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heart%20rate"}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[],"long_answer":"The main role of a sinoatrial node cell, or SA node, is to initiate action potentials of the heart, so that it can pass throughout the heart and cause contraction.
