    " \n    ATLANTA (AP) — Donald Trump and 18 allies were indicted in Georgia on Monday over their efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, with prosecutors using a statute normally associated with mobsters to accuse the former president, lawyers and other aides of a “criminal enterprise” to keep him in power.\n    The nearly 100-page indictment details dozens of acts by Trump or his allies to undo his defeat, including beseeching Georgia’s Republican secretary of state to find enough votes for him to win the battleground state; harassing an election worker who faced false claims of fraud; and attempting to persuade Georgia lawmakers to ignore the will of voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electors favorable to Trump.\n    In one particularly brazen episode, it also outlines a plot involving one of his lawyers to access voting machines in a rural Georgia county and steal data from a voting machine company.\n    \"The indictment alleges that rather than abide by Georgia’s legal process for election challenges, the defendants engaged in a criminal racketeering enterprise to overturn Georgia’s presidential election result,” Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, whose office brought the case, said at a late-night news conference.\n    Other defendants include former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; Trump attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; and a Trump administration Justice Department official, Jeffrey Clark, who aided the then-president's efforts to undo his election loss in Georgia. Other lawyers who advanced legally dubious ideas to overturn the results, including John Eastman, Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, were also charged.\n    Willis said the defendants would be permitted to voluntarily surrender by noon Aug. 25. She also said she plans to seek a trial date within six months and that she intends to try the defendants collectively.\n    The indictment bookends a remarkable crush of criminal cases — four in five months, each in a different city — that would be daunting for anyone, never mind someone like Trump who is simultaneously balancing the roles of criminal defendant and presidential candidate.\n    It comes just two weeks after the Justice Department special counsel charged him in a vast conspiracy to overturn the election, underscoring how prosecutors after lengthy investigations that followed the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol have now, two-and-a-half years later, taken steps to hold Trump to account for an assault on the underpinnings of American democracy.\n    The Georgia case covers some of the same ground as Trump’s recent indictment in Washington, including attempts he and his allies made to disrupt the electoral vote count at the Capitol. But in its sprawling web of defendants — 19 in total — the indictment stands apart from the more tightly targeted case brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which so far only names Trump as a defendant.\n    In charging close Trump aides who were referenced by Smith only as unindicted co-conspirators, the Georgia indictment alleges a scale of criminal conduct extending far beyond just the ex-president.\n    The indictment, with charges under the state's racketeering law and language conjuring the seedy underworld of mob bosses and gang leaders, accuses the former president, his former chief of staff, Trump’s attorneys and the ex-New York mayor of being members of a “criminal organization” and “enterprise” that operated in Georgia and other states.\n    The indictment capped a chaotic day at the courthouse caused by the brief but mysterious posting on a county website of a list of criminal charges that were to be brought against the former president. Reuters, which published a copy of the document, said the filing was taken down quickly.\n    A Willis spokesperson said in the afternoon that it was “inaccurate\" to say that an indictment had already been returned but declined to comment further on a kerfuffle that the Trump legal team jumped on to attack the investigation's integrity.\n    Trump and his allies, who have characterized the investigation as politically motivated, immediately seized on the apparent error to claim that the process was rigged. Trump’s campaign aimed to fundraise off it, sending out an email with the since-deleted document embedded.\n    In a statement after the indictment was issued, Trump's legal team said “the events that have unfolded today have been shocking and absurd, starting with the leak of a presumed and premature indictment before the witnesses had testified or the grand jurors had deliberated and ending with the District Attorney being unable to offer any explanation.”\n    The lawyers said prosecutors presenting their case “relied on witnesses who harbor their own personal and political interests — some of whom ran campaigns touting their efforts against the accused.” \n    Trump responded to the indictment Tuesday by announcing a news conference for next week to present yet another “almost complete” report on the alleged fraud he has yet to prove nearly three years after the 2020 election.\n    Many of the 161 acts by Trump and his associates outlined in the Georgia indictment have already received widespread attention. That includes a Jan. 2, 2021, call in which Trump urged Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” the 11,780 votes needed to overturn his election loss. That call, prosecutors said, violated a Georgia law against soliciting a public official to violate their oath.\n    It also accuses Trump of making false statements and writings for a series of claims he made to Raffensperger and other state election officials, including that up to 300,000 ballots “were dropped mysteriously into the rolls” in the 2020 election, that more than 4,500 people voted who weren’t on registration lists and that a Fulton County election worker, Ruby Freeman, was a “professional vote scammer.”\n    Giuliani, meanwhile, is accused of making false statements for allegedly lying to lawmakers by claiming that more than 96,000 mail-in ballots were counted in Georgia despite there being no record of them having been returned to a county elections office, and that a voting machine in Michigan wrongly recorded 6,000 votes for Biden that were actually cast for Trump.\n    In a statement, Giuliani did not respond directly to the allegations but called the indictment an “affront to American democracy” and “just the next chapter in a book of lies.”\n    Also charged are individuals prosecutors say helped Trump and his allies on the ground in Georgia influence and intimidate election workers.\n    One man, Stephen Cliffgard Lee, was charged for allegedly traveling to Freeman's home “with intent to influence her testimony.” Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss testified to Congress last year about how Trump and his allies latched onto surveillance footage from November 2020 to accuse both women of committing voter fraud — allegations that were quickly debunked, yet spread widely across conservative media.\n    Both women, who are Black, faced death threats after the election.\n    The indictment also accuses Powell and several co-defendants of tampering with voting machines in Coffee County, Georgia, and stealing data belonging to Dominion Voting Systems, a producer of tabulation machines that has long been the focus of conspiracy theories. An attorney for Powell declined to comment.\n    According to evidence made public by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot, Trump allies targeted Coffee County in search of evidence to back their theories of widespread voter fraud, allegedly copying data and software.\n    Besides the two election-related cases, Trump faces a separate federal indictment accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents as well as a New York state case charging him with falsifying business records.\n    As indictments mount, Trump — the leading Republican candidate for president in 2024 — often invokes his distinction as the only former president to face criminal charges. He is campaigning and fundraising around these themes, portraying himself as the victim of Democratic prosecutors out to get him.\n    Republican allies once again quickly rallied to Trump’s defense. “Americans see through this desperate sham,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n    Associated Press writers Jeffrey Martin, Brynn Anderson, Bill Barrow, Jeff Amy in Atlanta; Jill Colvin and Michael R. Sisak in New York; Russ Bynum in Savannah, Georgia; Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston; Farnoush Amiri in Washington; Christine Fernando in Chicago; Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho; Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia; and Lea Skene in Baltimore contributed to this report.

    " \n    The White House recently announced that it has decided to provide about $345 million worth of military \"assistance\" to the Taiwan island under the \"Presidential Drawdown Authority\" framework. This marks the first use of the PDA by the Joe Biden administration to sell arms, including offensive weaponry, to Taiwan. This shift underscores a new aspect of US arms sales to Taiwan, intensifying tensions across the Taiwan Strait and straining the foundation of Sino-US relations. \n    First, it marks a shift in US policy, from supplying defensive arms to providing offensive weaponry to the island. According to the \"Taiwan Relations Act\" that the United States passed in 1979, Washington can provide Taiwan with only arms of a defensive nature. \n    In the Sino-US Joint Communique of Aug 17, 1982, the US said that it does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan, that its arms sales to Taiwan will not exceed, either in qualitative or in quantitative terms, the level of those supplied in recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing, and that it intends to gradually reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan, leading, over a period of time, to a final resolution. \n    However, in recent years, the US has openly violated its own legal provisions and political commitments by selling sophisticated, offensive weaponry to Taiwan. Examples include the $8 billion deal for 66 F-16V fighter jets, $1 billion worth of 135 AGM-84H SLAM-ER air-to-ground missiles, high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and more. \n    This departure from the commitment to supply only defensive arms not only casts a shadow over cross-Strait peace but also risks undermining the strategic credibility of the US. \n    Second, it marks the normalization of regular arms sales to the island. In the past, the US often bundled arms sales in comprehensive packages to Taiwan. For example, during the Barack Obama administration, Taiwan received $14.07 billion worth of military equipment in three batches, including Patriot Advanced Capability-3(PAC-3) missiles, Black Hawk helicopters, and upgrades to F-16A/B fighter jets. \n    However, in recent years, a new \"conventional arms transfer\" policy has emerged, streamlining arms exports and facilitating the normalization of arms transfers. Since US President Joe Biden assumed office in 2021, the frequency of US arms sales to Taiwan has notably increased, with more than 10 arms sales in just about two and a half years. This trend is likely to continue, further deteriorating Sino-US relations. \n    And third, it marks a shift from conventional arms sales to the sale of weapons of an offensive nature under the US \"Presidential Drawdown Authority \"framework. Previously, US arms sales to Taiwan used to undergo a series of procedural reviews, including administrative approval and even congressional scrutiny for larger-scale transactions. But now the US is using new tactics to \"fast track \"arms sales to Taiwan, bypassing the complex and lengthy review processes. \n    Since the US draws parallels between the Taiwan question and the Ukraine crisis, which Washington has been prolonging by providing military aid for Kyiv, this shift in strategy raises concerns that the US might be using the \"Ukraine model\" of military assistance in the case of Taiwan, potentially paving the way for a \"today Ukraine, tomorrow Taiwan\" scenario. \n    There are multifaceted objectives behind the US' latest move. The US has identified China as a \"strategic competitor\" in its National Security Strategy. By playing the \"Taiwan card\", the US aims to weaken the Chinese mainland's political, economic and military capabilities, thereby slowing its modernization efforts. \n    Militarily, the US seeks to maintain its dominance in the Asia-Pacific region, and increase its interactions with Taiwan under the pretext of the so-called Taiwan Relations Act, turning Taiwan into a \"hedgehog\" or a \"porcupine\" against the mainland, and integrating it into its \"Indo-Pacific strategy\". And economically, this approach serves the interests of the US military-industrial complex, using Taiwan as a source of considerable profit. \n    The continuous drain on Taiwan's resources due to arms purchases from the US will have dire consequences. The Taiwan authorities have limited bargaining power against the US, which means they have to pay much higher prices than other buyers for the same weapons. The huge amounts of money Taiwan pays to the US to buy arms could have been used to improve the island's economy and Taiwan residents' livelihoods, especially at a time when the island has been grappling with economic challenges, including months of declining exports and negative economic growth in the first half of 2023. \n    Besides, the refusal of the Democratic Progressive Party administration to accept the 1992 Consensus that there is only one China and Taiwan is an integral part of China, and its pro-independence agenda have escalated tensions across the Strait. \n    Moreover, the US, through arms sales and other actions, has been provoking Beijing and encouraging the DPP to continue its pro-independence activities, which could spark conflict across the Strait. It's high time therefore that the US realized the Taiwan question lies at the core of the Chinese nation's vital interests and serves as a foundational pillar of Sino-US relations. \n    To facilitate a return to a healthier trajectory of Sino-US relations, the US must adhere to the one-China principle, and stop using Taiwan as a tool to contain the mainland. And the Taiwan authorities should realize the US' actions do not serve the island's best interests; instead, they have the potential to lead the island down a treacherous path. Continuing to be obstinate and ignoring the reality of the situation would only result in self-inflicted harm for Taiwan. \n    The author is an associate professor at the school of national security, University of International Relations.

    " \n    One of the primary aims of the 2002 Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication Related Information Act (Rica) was to allow authorities to legally and appropriately track down, or intercept, communications linked to criminal activities and attribute these to an individual, company or group. \n    Rica, which only fully came into effect years later, is best known for doing this in terms of the regulation of mobile network SIM cards for cellular phones. \n    The legislation requires SIM cards to be registered to an individual along with that person’s physical address. This measure is meant to allow authorities to trace a number identified during a criminal investigation to an individual, company or group to whom that number is registered. \n    However, just over 20 years since the legislation was first introduced, the evidence available seems to suggest there is a flaw in its implementation. \n    Crime, of all varieties, has unfortunately long been an issue in South Africa, and in the post-Covid, ailing economy, recent crime stats show the problem is only escalating. In this environment, police need to be able to rely on all the tools at their disposal when investigating crime – and one of these tools should be Rica. \n    While there is unfortunately a lack of data on how many criminal investigations have either been assisted or impeded by poor or non-compliance with Rica, media reports on crime stories frequently point to unregistered SIM cards as a challenge for criminal investigations. \n    Moreover, journalists have undertaken their own investigations and run stories on just how easy it is to acquire unregistered SIM cards. \n    A in 2020 reported that illegally registered SIM cards in South Africa were hampering investigations by the South African Police Service (SAPS). According to the article, a source claimed that police investigations up to that point had uncovered thousands of unregistered SIM cards which were available for as little as R5 each. The article further reported that, according to its source, police could trace numbers involved in criminal activity back to a legitimately registered individual in only about 10% of cases. \n    cites police sources in inner-city precincts who have stated that the SIM cards used by criminals are mostly sourced from informal stores, like spaza shops; however, these sources also implicated formal business sellers of these products. \n    The result of this easily accessible market for unregistered SIM cards is the all-too-easy and consequence-free coordination of all kinds of crime, including serious and violent crime. This means that for the cost of a few of these R5 unregistered SIM cards, planning a murder, for example, becomes untraceable by SAPS through Rica, and thus virtually risk-free. \n    Yet report from December 2022 covered the politically linked assassination of AmaZulu Prince Mbongiseni Milton Muntukaphiwana Zulu, together with his bodyguard in KwaZulu-Natal, as well as numerous other politically linked killings in the province at the time. \n    Mary de Haas, a violence monitor and academic, described the political “hits” in the province as “so easy”. De Haas specifically mentions the use of unregistered SIM cards in relation to these murders which are believed to be linked to hitmen in the taxi industry. \n    An unregistered SIM card was also reported in coverage of death threats made against Eskom’s former chief operations officer Jan Oberholzer last year. \n    If one thinks about any type of crime in a technology-driven world, the use of a cellphone is likely to be involved. Given the ease with which unregistered SIM cards seem to be available, this makes this facet of planning crime, from fraud to murder, easy and almost impossible to trace back to a source without any other evidence. \n    Under Rica legislation, telecommunications companies are required to register the users on their networks. This has often been a responsibility which networks have delegated to distribution companies and Rica agents who sell the SIM cards which connect users to mobile networks. \n    Somewhere along this chain of responsibility, it is clear that something is going seriously wrong. \n    The pre-registration of SIM cards is further enabled by a deterioration in the built-in security features that should be included in SIM card packaging. The result is the mass sale of non-tamper-proof and easily visible SIM cards that can be replicated by bad actors and used in criminal activity. \n    As a result of these lapses in SIM card security, one of the investigative reports into the availability of unregistered SIM cards noted that when tracing numbers used in criminal cases, details were often just a mixture of numbers and letters which meant nothing. \n    This shows that somewhere in the process of distributing SIM cards and registering the details of mobile network users, actors with access to the Rica registration system are purposefully contravening the law with impunity. \n    In a country that is beset with serious crime challenges and having recently been greylisted by global financial crime watchdog the Financial Action Task Force, it is clear that implementation issues associated with Rica and the proliferation of unregistered SIM cards are an important avenue which warrants further serious investigation. \n    This non-compliance represents a serious loophole which criminals can easily exploit with little fear of consequence. \n    Rica should provide the police, who are already seriously resource-constrained, with reliable information in the majority of cases where cellular phones are linked to a crime. \n    A review of the act’s implementation to identify where unregistered SIM cards are entering the system is well overdue.
